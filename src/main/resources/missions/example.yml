# EasyMissions - Mission config
# Any valid mission config file in the missions folder/directory will work. Feel free to categorize by file
# Each top-level key is stored on the mission item. Keep the keys short
# Because of the above, existing mission items with missing entries will not work
# For a full explanation and list of mission types, examples, and options, read the wiki and make sure to check default.yml
# This file can be deleted when you have another .yml file in the directory, it will regenerate when there is no valid mission configs in the directory

# Here is a mission that will utilize all possible options right now. Don't be afraid of how big it looks right now, it gets way shorter using defaults

break_stone: # Mission top-level key
  # Item display stuff
  name: "<gray>Stone Breaker</gray>" # Mission item display name
  completed_name: "<green>[NAME] (COMPLETED)</green>" # [NAME] will be replaced with the normal name

  lore: # Mission item lore. Use <task> to display the description below, there are many other placeholders you may use, check the wiki
    - "<task>"
    - ""
    - "<white>Progress: <green><progress></green>/<red><requirement></red></white>"

  completed_lore: # Lore when completed, [LORE!] in the first line will make it the normal lore but strikethrough
    - "<gray>You have cleared the path.</gray>"
    - ""
    - "<gold>Right-click to claim!</gold>"

  task: "Clear out the stone to make way for progress." # An objective of what to do to progress the mission, useful combined with default.yml
  item_rarity: "COMMON" # The minecraft item rarity of the item (cosmetic only)
  item_material: "PAPER" # The type of item for the mission. It's recommended to keep this at paper and use item_model to change its texture to avoid issues, https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.21.11/org/bukkit/Material.html for valid materials
  item_model: # Custom item model, leave empty or remove if you don't wish to have a custom texture, you can use existing textures like minecraft:stone too
  completed_item_model: # Item model when completed, leave empty or remove to default to item model

  # Mission settings
  category: "easy" # Must match a category in config.yml
  type: "break" # Mission type, see wiki for list
  requirement_range: 4-59
  blacklisted_worlds: [ "world_the_nether" ] # Worlds that this mission will not progress on.
  targets: # section to specify conditions for mission to progress, what you can have depends on the chosen type
    materials:
      - "*_STONE" # wildcard for any block ending with stone, you can also use exact names like STONE or COBBLESTONE

  # Custom options are additional settings for your mission config, other plugins can add their own options for you
  # An existing option is the permission one, it makes the mission only work for that permission or if you have one of the permissions
  custom_options:
    permission:
      values:
        - "easymissions.break"
  # Commands to run on mission claim.
  # "say" will send a message to the player, not the minecraft command
  # "minecraft:say" runs the real minecraft command
  rewards:
    - "say <green>Good job, you completed the mission yayay!"
    - "give <player> cobblestone 64"

# Above is a full, functional mission with all options that should have a requirement between 4 and 59 and progresses when a player breaks any block ending with stone.
# Additionally, you can configure the defaults of a mission to avoid repetition and allow for better readability. Check default.yml for that
