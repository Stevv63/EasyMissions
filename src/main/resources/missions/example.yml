# EasyMissions - Example Mission Config
#
# This file demonstrates how to create missions. You can create multiple .yml files inside the 'missions' folder.
# Each top level key (like "break_stone") is a unique mission config ID.
# For a full explanation and tutorial of types, options, and placeholders, please check the wiki, also check the default.yml file.

# EXAMPLE 1: A fully detailed mission explaining all possible fields.
break_stone: # the top level key

  # Use a template from default.yml. If omitted, the base one named "default" is used.
  default: default

  # Item display stuff

  name: "<gray>Stone Breaker</gray>" # Mission item display name
  completed_name: "<green>[NAME] (COMPLETED)</green>" # [NAME] will be replaced with the normal name

  lore: # The lore of the mission item
    - "<task>" # The <task> placeholder displays the task specified below, useful when combined with default.yml's lore
    - ""
    - "<white>Progress: <green><progress></green>/<red><requirement></red></white>"


  completed_lore: # Lore when completed.
    - "[LORE!]" # [LORE!] will add the lore above but strikethrough
    - ""
    - "<gray>You have cleared the path.</gray>"
    - ""
    - "<gold>Right-click to claim!</gold>"

  # Item settings

  task: "Clear out the stone to make way for progress." # Description of what to do to progress the mission
  item_rarity: "COMMON" # COMMON, UNCOMMON, RARE, EPIC
  item_material: "PAPER" # Any valid Bukkit Material. It's recommended to use PAPER and specify `item_model` for a custom texture.
  item_model: "" # Sets a custom texture on the item. Can be empty to not use one.
  completed_item_model: "" # Texture when completed, leave empty to default to item model

  # Mission settings

  category: "easy" # Must match a category in config.yml
  type: "break" # The action required to progress. See wiki for a list.
  requirement_range: 4-59 # A random requirement between 20 and 60 (inclusive). see wiki for more details on it.
  blacklisted_worlds: [ "world_the_nether" ] # Worlds that this mission will not progress on.

  # Conditions for the mission to progress. The available conditions depend on the `type` you set.
  targets:
    materials:
      - "*STONE" # wildcard for any block ending with stone, you can also use exact names like STONE or COBBLESTONE

  # You may also omit the "targets:" section and directly set the conditions, it would be like this:
  # materials:
  #   - "*STONE"

  # Custom options are additional settings for your mission config, other plugins can add their own options for you
  # a built-in option is `permission`, the mission only progresses for players with any of the permissions
  custom_options:
    permission: # this is our permission option
      values:
        - "easymissions.break" # players must have this permission.

  # Commands to run on mission claim.
  # "say" will send a message to the player, not the minecraft command
  # "minecraft:say" runs the real minecraft command
  # [REWARDS!] will execute the default rewards alongside your rewards if you put it
  rewards:
    - "say <green>Good job, you completed the mission yayay!" # send a message to the player
    - "give <player> cobblestone 64" # give the player 64 cobblestone

# Above is a full, functional mission with all options that should have a requirement between 4 and 59 and progresses when a player breaks any block ending with stone.
# Additionally, you can configure the defaults of a mission to avoid repetition and allow for better readability. Check default.yml for that
